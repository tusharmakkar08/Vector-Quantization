# Vector-Quantization <br>

This is the generalized code for Vector Quantization . <br>
There are 2 important files in this :<br>
* `test.py` : It has code for making test cases. Documentation of the <br>
function is given in the code 
* `main.py` : It has main code for Vector Quantization. It supports <br>
3 types of aggregation : `min` , `max` and `avg` . It also supports 2 types <br>
of similarity matrix namely  `manhattan distance` and `euclidean distance`. <br>

It can be run through following code : <br>
`python main.py`
